    "There are many ways to browse through a SQL database, throughout this Appendix we are only going to be focusing on learning about SQL queries using a combination of SQLite,Python,pandas, and SQLAlchemy. Please note that this is a pretty specific way of operating with a SQL Database, and may or may not fit other general needs. The primary goal of this section is to teach you how to use SQL queries to grab information and set it as a pandas DataFrame. We will not be going over more general topics of relational databases, MySQL, or using a SQL console directly.\n",

    "\n",
    "To start this appendix, download SQLAlchemy. You can do this by either downloading it [here](http://www.sqlalchemy.org/download.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "*Or* -  by typing pip install sqlalchemy in your command line.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Or* - by typing conda install sqlalchemy if you are using the Anaconda installation of Python. *(recommended)*\n",

    "#### Step 2: Download SQLite Broswer\n",
    "\n",
    "Next up we will download a sql browser. We will be using SQLite Browser because it is lightweight and free to use. There are many alternatives you can use, check out a list of 10 free ones [here](http://www.gfi.com/blog/top-10-free-database-tools-for-sys-admins/)\n",
    "\n",
    "Download SQLite Browser here: http://sqlitebrowser.org/\n",

    "You can download the fully constructed database [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/t049qmjzycrakro/sakila.db?dl=0)\n",
    "\n",
    "*Or* - you can download the .sql file to construct the database yourself: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/index-other.html\n",
    "Then use SQLite Browser to construct the database by running the .sql\n",
    "\n",
    "Either way, make sure to save it in the same directory as your iPython notebooks, or remember the file path for later so we can tell pandas exactly where to look for it.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### All done! Now let's look at the database before diving into how to work with it in Python.\n",
